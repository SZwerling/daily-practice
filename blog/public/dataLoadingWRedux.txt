General Data Loading With Redux
________________________________

Component gets rendered onto the screen.                          // Components are generally responsibile for fetching
Component's 'componentDidMount' lifecycle method gets called.     // data they need by calling an action creator.
We call action creator from 'componentDidMount'.                  // Very common to put inside componentDidMount,


Action creator runs code to make an API request. (Using Axios)    // Action creators are responsible for making API reqs.
API responds with data.                                           // This is where redux-thunk comes into play.
Action creator returns an 'action' object with the fetched data on the 'payload' property.


Action object gets sent to all the reducers.                       // We get fetched data into a comp by generating new state
Some reducer sees the action, returns the data off the 'payload'.  // in our redux store, then getting that into the comp through
Because we generated a new state object, redux/react-redux cause our react app to be rerendered.  // mapStateToProps.



REDUX THUNK MIDDLEWARE
________________________________

Gets called whenever and action creator gets dispatched, before it gets to reducers.
With thunk the action creator can return an object OR A FUNCTION.
If a function is returned, then thunk calls the function.
